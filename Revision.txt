important points:
----------------
1. Useeffect is the place where we fetch the data.

2. { } // using single bracket like this means we are keeping some dynamic thing inside it.

3.  onClick={handleAdduser} // argument to the onclick must be reference to function.
    onClick={() => handleAdduser()} //(preferred syntax) the arrow function is a reference. but handleAdduser must be a function call.
    onClick={() => {handleAdduser()}} // this also works.

4. Throwing errors: (Error handling if the api response is not expected)
    throw new Error('something went wrong');
    
    try {
        const response = await axios.get('some end point');
        if(!response.data.userDetails) {
            throw new Error('user Details not found');
        }
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }

5. How to create custom hooks

    custom hooks in react must start with keyword called "use".
    eg: useFetch, useFetchedData ..etc
    custom hooks are nothing but making reusable code. 
    custom hooks similar to composable functions in vue3.

6. use event.preventDefault() when you want to stop the default action associated with the event from happening.
