In React, functional components can be either stateless or stateful, depending on whether they use hooks. Class components are traditionally considered stateful, but they can also be stateless.

Here’s a breakdown:
1. Functional Components:

    Initially, functional components were stateless because they didn’t have the ability to manage state or lifecycle methods.
    With the introduction of React Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect), functional components can now manage their own state and lifecycle events, making them stateful if needed.

// Stateful functional component using hooks
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

2. Class Components:

    Class components have been traditionally stateful because they can use the state property and lifecycle methods.
    However, a class component can also be stateless if it doesn’t use this.state or lifecycle methods.

// Stateless class component
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

Summary:

    Functional components can be both stateless and stateful (thanks to hooks).
    Class components are typically stateful but can also be stateless.
