javascript:
-----------
when some variable(which is used in dom) is updated, then whole dom gets rerendered.
this is costly operation.

react:
-----
React maintains a virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is lightweight when compared to Actual DOM.
if some variable / State is updated, then React updates the virtual DOM (whole virtual DOM rerenders), then calculates the difference between the current and previous virtual DOM states (this process is called reconciliation), and then using react Libraries it only updates the changed elements in the real DOM.
this way we can avoid rerendering of whole DOM.

Comparision b/w Virtual DOM and actual DOM is done by diffing algorithm

(even through whole virtual dom renderes, it is less costly operation than whole Actual dom rendering)


How ReactJS works behind the scenes?
-----------------------------------
ReactJS works by creating a virtual representation of the DOM called the `virtual DOM`, which is a lightweight copy of the `Real dom`.
 When the state of the `UI changes`, React `updates the virtual DOM` and efficiently determines what changes need to be made to the `Real dom` to reflect the `new state`. This allows for fast and efficient updates to the UI `without` requiring a `full reload` of the page.
