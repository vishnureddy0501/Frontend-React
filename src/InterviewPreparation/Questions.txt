React: it is a Library. Not Framework

what is React ?
--------------
Library for Building User Interfaces

features of React ?
------------------
1. JSX (JavaScript XML)
2. Component-Based Architecture
3. Virtual DOM
5. State Management
    You can manage state locally in components using hooks like useState or globally using libraries like Redux, React Context API, or MobX.
6. Hooks
9. Unidirectional Data Flow
    In React, data flows in a single direction, from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to reason about your application and helps with debugging.

10. React Router
11. Context API
12. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
    React can be rendered on the server using frameworks like Next.js, which improves performance and SEO (since HTML is pre-rendered on the server).
13. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
    React supports code splitting and lazy loading to improve performance by only loading parts of the app when they are needed, instead of loading the entire app at once.
    Example using React.lazy():
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));

Default Values in Props:
------------------------
"male" is the default value for gender prop.

const ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = "male" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <p>{gender}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
