1. Declare Every function as arrow function in react JS. (very very important)

executing some block of code before the functional component is unmounted:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here runs when the component is mounted (on mount)
    console.log("Component mounted");

    // The return function acts as the cleanup (before unmount)
    return () => {
      console.log("Component is about to be unmounted");
      // This is equivalent to beforeDestroy
      // Do cleanup tasks like removing event listeners, timers, etc.
    };
  }, []); // The empty array ensures this runs only on mount and unmount

  return <div>My Component</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
