things need to learn:
-----------------------

class components (No Need to learn)
server side rendering vs client side rendering definitions ?
what is single page application ?
what is jsx ?
what is strict mode?
---------------------
strict mode runs the application twice. this is for debugging purpose.
for actual build in production, it will run only once.

props are immutable in any language. it means you should not change props.
if you destructure the props to another variable and changed that variable value.  (this doesn't means you changed props)
 but props are immutable.

 Pro tip:
 ---------
always use arrow functions only. (for both class components, functional components)
